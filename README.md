# Code-Quiz

This is a Code Quiz that adds points when the correct answer is chosen.  
There is a timer where time is deducted when the incorrect answer is selected.  
At the end of the quiz, either by answering all of the questions, or the timer running out of time, the total score is displayed giving the user an option to save their initials.  
The user's initials are saved to the browser's local storage to retreive their highest score.  
At the end of the quiz, the user can restart the quiz to try to get a higher score.
